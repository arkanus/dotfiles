# My Dotfiles

Magic things happen when you expose them to direct sunlight.

## Warning!

My vimrc is pretty old and messed up, also most comments are in spanish.

## Dependencies

For the moment all of them are vim specific :P
Also uses Vundle, but it's included as a submodule :O

## Installation

    git clone git://github.com/arkanus/dotfiles.git dotfiles.git
    cd dotfiles.git
    git submodule update --init
    ./install.sh

This will also download and install all configured vim plugins using Vundle (yipee!)
